Hello there!
============

This is a rapid hack, I wrote it on a laptop in the glorious British sun (!) so if you think you can write the code better, then you probably can and should! Clone the repo and send me a pull request â€” after all, [it's all a bit of fun](http://twitter.com/mxcl/status/16838493726).

If you want to know what on earth is going on here, your best bet is to have a look at the [heroku app](http://pottymouth.heroku.com), the [how to page](http://pottymouth.heroku.com/howto) might help you out too.

Ummmm

Yes, It's horribly inefficient. More than about 3 post-receive requests in succesion will break it. I'm looking into how to scan the text-based data from a git repo without having to clone it.
